How I Created my Web Portfolio?

I used my High Fidelity Prototype from the User Experience Design class to help shape my website. The website includes
3 pages. A home page, about page, and portfolio page. I started off by typing out all of the html as my portfolio
had all of the titles and paragraphs I needed to make the content on the website. I organized all of the images
of my past work in folders to help quickly sort through and find which images I needed. I really wanted to make use
of the grid system in css, so when I got to styling my page I was already planning out which divs were going to
be used to break up my website into pieces. I found it simple to colour and re-size my text for the different
media queries, but I had to spend a lot of time on the header on my Web Portfolio. The navigation for mobile was
not difficult to code, but what I struggled with was the shift from a vertical menu to a horizontal menu. I had
to figure out how to space the navigation and offset it to the top right of the screen through more grids and
margin adjustments. I stuck with it and eventually fixed the tablet and desktop navigation while making it look
almost identical to the prototype. What I learned most in this process was the management of divs / sections.
It is important to think ahead in your design of what might need to be grouped together or what will be turned
into a grid display. I also learned to use grids inside of other grids, like on my portfolio page. I used a grid
for the illustrator panels, but also had a grid around that grid of both the illustrator and photoshop section.
